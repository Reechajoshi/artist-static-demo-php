      <p><span class="poonam">A commissioned permanent installation of chequered windows by Yogesh Barve, 2013. The work is part of a larger series called, 'equality/inequality', to do with the paradoxes of attaining balance and equal arrangements of rectangular shapes. </span></p>
      <p><span class="poonam">Clark House was once a shipping office. Old, dusty model ships and navigation maps remain in the archives. When he saw it, Kemi Bassene thought Clark House looked like a big ship out at sea, with an upper and lower deck, and where every new exhibition is a docking at a new port, along the cultural cross-routes of slave, colonial, immigrant or space ships. Playing with the idea of a deck of cards, and the windows of a ship deck, this commission by Yogesh Barve will remain permanently in the space. </span></p>
      <p><span class="poonam">&quot;While looking at Clark House's windows, I found some connections between them...In the middle, all 4 windows are related to each other with cross, horizontal and vertical mirrorings, so I made the arrangements balance in these ways, often like the move of a horse-chess-piece across 4 squares. Elsewhere there are two windows on the same wall, so I just wanted to merge them into one window and that is why the composition seems like a brick-game. One window seemed very individual, so I balanced the glass panes within the window.  Two windows relate to exhaust fans, one outside the window, one in the storage room. The number of frosted glass panes are 7; and number of green  panes are also 7. Just because the exhaust fan is inside the window, the composition is balanced, (conceptually).&quot; - YB</span></p>

            <p class="poonam">Ma Gnias Casset (1908 -1992) was a child of Saint Louis, capital of the FWA (French West Africa) before being a non commissioned officer French Air Army. But he was a photographer before being military. He joined the Belgian photographer Oscar Lataque at Dakar to learn his future job the year the First World War finished. He was ten years old.</p>
            <p class="poonam">Aerial photography was important to map the French colonial empire. Casset spent fifteen years serving the army. He portrayed all important figures of that era, from colonial representatives to local religious leaders. He was most proud of having been the first black to capture the General De Gaulle than having portrayed Leopold Sedar Senghor as first President of Senegal Republic. This spirit could be explained by the fact that Casset is a native of one of the French territories in colonial Africa (Saint-Louis, Gorée, Rufisque, Dakar). The rest was considered indigenous. Casset had early to find a supportive aesthetic photography that may accompany the new still fragile and heavily depending to decades of colonial occupation Senegalese Republic.</p>
            <p class="poonam">His challenge reflects the one led politically by the Presidents Senghor and Boigny in Senegal and Ivory Coast after independences. The duality of having actively served the colonial power and of having participated later to help young nations to make history.</p>
            <p class="poonam">To define African Photography is like identifying African Literature or African &quot;Philosophy&quot;. Photographers at the time of Gnias Casset had indirectly created a procession among the colonial subjects, which mimed the aesthetics of the colonists Signares and mulattos in studios. The aesthetics of the current winner weber consciously reproduced.</p>
            <p class="poonam">A critical African Literature in images would have required an African translated thought into European languages by photography. Casset had searched with its multicultural limits the translation of an African personality with the technical Colonial tool, as many thinkers coming from the colonies did. He tried to exceed his Kantian dimension in a way to offer a new disalienated and non-ideologist aesthetic in agreement with all social and cultural lived experiences. - KB on his grandfather's studio, Mama Casset.</p>

      <p class="poonam">Strategies of equality have informed the work of Clark House Initiative since it began in the metropolis of Bombay. Re-reading histories, concerns of representation and visibility, and experiments with what an alternative economy could be became part of their strategy to imagine things differently, to gauge the extent to which we might be free. In their MJ blog, Clark House Initiative intends to actively recall political and artistic figures into contemporaneity, and to question the recent rise of fascism in India based on exaggerated rumours of economic prosperity and nationalist pride.</p>
      <p class="poonam">Clark House Initiative, based in Bombay, was established in 2010 by Zasha Colah and Sumesh Sharma as a curatorial collaborative concerned with ideas of freedom. They curated &lsquo;I C U JEST&rsquo;, a collateral event of the first Kochi-Muziris Biennale (12/12/12) and more recently, were in residence at the Kadist Art Foundation in Paris. </p>

        <div>'<span class="poonam">Everything is the truth' is a Marathi-English publication that recognizes that the truth is a variable, fluid concept. The selection of 24 truths are contradictory akin to opinions and views of their authors. The interactive format of the book allows for a non-hierarchical viewing in which no one truth is elevated above any other truth and neither Marathi nor English is favored. The 24 truths included in the artist book 'Everything is the truth' were collected during a multilingual performance titled 'Certifying the Truth' at the Sir JJ School of Art Annual Exhibition in February 2013.  During that performance the artist offered to certify the authenticity of any statement that was presented to her as the 'truth' by the audience. Cayla then asked the artists Sachin Bonde, Nikhil Raunak, Prasad Nikumb and Mangesh Kapse to serigraph these 24 truths into billingual editions in English and Marathi. The work is brave and significant in the equality with which it places both languages, but also, the playful equanimity with which it upholds each opinionated statement as equally true as another. </span></div>

        <div class="poonam">Groupe Dix10, a Paris-based collective established in 1982 by JJ Dow Jones and Roma Napoli, began with interventions that questioned the supermarket of art, by creating multiples that took re-constructed artworks as consumables. One of their earliest works, on display, is a lithograph that resembles the visual apparatus of an expensive Daniel Buren work on canvas. They called it 'Litho of Buren' with an 'edition of 10/10', but with an actual edition of 100, and a price that was then negligible. They made an argument that questioned the veracity of values put on works by the market and the supermarket of art based on the idea of exclusive authorship. Using serigraphy and lithography they made numerous editions and created a satire on the existing rules of buying and owning art. </div>

    <p>Autobiografia, borrows its title from Gertrude Stein's anecdotal literary work on her lover Alice B Toklas. It seeks to make inquiries into the unknown traditions in Cubism, to make those conversations which saw the artist as a political citizen, discussions of feminism, and a certain refusal of recognition based on matters of gender, although Felicia Pacnowska's works are in the stores of the British Museum, Centre Georges Pompidou and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum London. Drawings, lithographs, serigraphs, etchings and photographs are brought together to narrate a history and to make a fictional encounter between people like Felicia Pacnowska, a Polish Jew who survived the holocaust, and Justin Daraniyagala a reclusive Sri Lankan painter who exhibited with Picasso, Braque. Yogesh Barve discusses the railway lines scraping throught the urbanscape as they enter the suburbs and the corresponding change in the skyline using coloform and etching, which is placed in conversation with Prabhakar Barwe's abstractions that might depict movement, and George Braque's serigraph where the phrase 'Conformism begins at its definition'  is annotated in flowers. A unique lithograph of Salvodor Dali depicts Don Quixote, while a a set of Picasso's minotaurs are placed in relation to Goya's bullfighting series. </p>

          <div><span class="poonam">(silent video, 8 minutes)</span></div>
          <div><span class="poonam">Shot in super 8 in Trinidad, the film is a pictorial travel through the parades of the Trinidad Carnival. It guides and associates the spectator into the dances and the errance of masquareders coated with paint in Port of Spain's streets at the time of Jouvert - a party created by slaves, which anounces the opening of the carnival. Jouvert coincides with the emancipation of the slaves in 1838 in Trinidad and Tobago and testifies to their found freedom. The traditions of make-up and of traversals of Jouvert were born with the beginning of civil disturbances in Port of Spain. To mask their faces, the demonstrators smeared themselves with mud or paint. Trinidadians keep this ritual during carnival. Pascale Obolo creates a bridge between Africa and the Caribbean as a testimony, a pictoral poetry with her moving fresco, a shared heritage of the worlds of slavery. Each time Pascale plays the film, she invites a different aritst to collaborate with her to produce a new interpretive sound for the work. Jay One Ramier and Louisa Babari have collaborated together to make a sound score for this screening.</span></div>

            <p><span class="poonam">&lsquo;Music for (prepared) bicycles&rsquo; (after John Cage &amp; Marcel Duchamp) / Part One: Bombay&rsquo; is a participatory performance project in process by Caecilia Tripp celebrating the  hundredth birthday of John Cage through &lsquo;a music made by everyone&rsquo; in the streets. Wanting to take Cage to the streets, the artist finds ways to democratise the many makers, the conductor, the composer, the performer, the spectator, the on-looker, the bystander, the passer-by, as equals within her participatory score. To create her score, and a film, the artist made a sonic bicycle, like a moving instrument, spiked with electric guitar strings, capturing street sounds, and sounds of strings hitting playing cards, as it is performed trilling through places of affect within the city. This project in process alters Cage&rsquo;s 'prepared piano' into three sonic bicycle processions, a &lsquo;music of change&rsquo; thriving through three global metropoles as the bondage of a freed geography, beyond all boundaries. Part Two &amp; Part Three of &ldquo;Music for (prepared) bicycles&rdquo; will be taking place in New York and Cape Town, South Africa. &lsquo;Music for (prepared) bicycles&rsquo; (after John Cage &amp; Marcel Duchamp) / Part One : Bombay was co-produced with Clarkhouse Initiative Bombay together with the French Institute and Rattapallax Films NY. Part Two &amp; Part Three of 'Music for (prepared) bicycles' will be taking place in New York and Cape Town, South Africa. Performer: Nikhil Raunak.

This is where my desire to create a unique costume, which is impossible to replicate, came into existence. &lsquo;Impression&rsquo; is a jacket, which is a product of my performance before camera. The mediums used are henna, fevicol - a synthetic resin adhesive, and my body. My body becomes a machine and heat from it helps the fevicol dry over a period of 24 hours, which is then peeled off. The peeled layer then contains the textures and wrinkles of my skin. Using henna and fevicol serve the purpose of contradicting each other. Henna is used as a temporary tattoo on hands and legs for decorative purpose, while fevicol helps me symbolize the fake nature of cosmetic products. They merge and create a surface of their own; to peel the so called &lsquo;dead skin&rsquo; from my body.</span></div>

            <div><span class="poonam">A theoretics is proposed through film, image, sound works and performative conversations that inhabit the exhibition space, briefly, for one day. Clark House invites art historian and author of 'Black is a Colour', Elvan Zabunyan, into conversation with the artist Caecilia Tripp in whose works there has been a consistent reference to the spirit of John Cage and Edouard Glissant. To begin the conversation, Caecilia Tripp screens the magnetic conversation she captures on film, when two brilliant minds, the writer Glissant and the poet Lynton Kwesi Johnson meet and talk. This small precise and humorous masterpiece is titled 'Making History', and unfolds gently through a filmed conversation and many strolls, slowly finds a shared understanding of the shades of meaning of words like identity, and a discovery of a position. Caecilia Tripp made a film about taking the music of John Cage to the streets of Bombay, Brooklyn and Sao Paolo. Within the present exhibiiton, a documentary about the choreographer Chandralekha (courtesy Sadanand Menon, the <a href="http://pad.ma/" target="_blank">pad.ma</a> archive and CAMP), An avant-garde anarchism is present in the dance of Chandralekha, which she shared with John Cage when they met. This crossroads of thought will be explored in the discussion as a means to open out other narratives within the exhibition, and the way modernism worked in parallel geographies. Two films are brought together and layered within the artist Prajakta Potnis's sculptural immersive installation, a 'room full of rooms', a room with multiple projections that re-construct the homes and windows of diverse populations of Paris. Dwelling on the writing of Arjun Appadurai's evocation of the role of the imagination as a social practice, and of art as a powerful tool for social commentary, which may spur political and cultural changes. This concept challenges us to negotiate our place within this imagined community in consideration of our own personal experiences as members of actual families and neighborhoods, with real ethnic and cultural histories, placing into context the idea of an &lsquo;artistic imagination&rsquo; and the &lsquo;social imagination&rsquo;. In his book, &lsquo;Decolonizing the Mind&rsquo;, Ngugi wa Thiong&rsquo;o writes, &lsquo;Since culture does not just reflect the world in images but actually, through those very images, conditions the colonial child to see that world in a certain way, the colonial child was made to see the world and where he stands in it as seen and defined by or reflected in the culture of the language of imposition.&rsquo; Yogesh Barve and Amol Patil question a certain social order within India, and an emerging order that constructs itself through globalisation through India. To this comes the revolutionary stance of the editorial collective Afrikadaa, committed to making visible African and especially francophone African art. They bring to this discussion, the philosophy of the jazz musician Sun Ra, and a philosophy of moving byond identity through Afro Futurism, looking at identity from the point of view of outer-space.</span></div>

          <div><span class="poonam"><strong>Caecilia Tripp</strong> is a conceptual artist using means of filmic Installation, photography as well as performance. Beyond geographical borders and with a poetic mind, her work shines a light on forms of freedom, utopia and civil disobedience at the crossroads of globalization. Using forms of &ldquo;re-enactment&rdquo; and &ldquo;rehearsals&rdquo; it dwells the space of collective imaginary as a participatory space of transgression and innovation, triggering social and cultural boundaries. Currently she is working on the triology &ldquo;Music for (prepared) Bicycles&rdquo; (after John Cage &amp; Marcel Duchamp), a participatory sonic performance and film project in three scores. Score One/ Bombay has been produced together with Clark House in Bombay in 2012, Score Two/ New York is in process right now with Brooklyn College NY and Score Three will take place in Cape Town, South Africa. Caecilia Tripp&rsquo;s work has been shown internationally in galleries, museums such as PS1/MOMA New York / USA, Palais de Tokyo Paris /France, Museum of Modern Art, Paris / France, Zacheta Gallery Warsaw / Poland, De Appel, Amsterdam / Netherlands, Roomade, Brussels / Belgium, Museum of Modern Art, Moscow / Russia, Center Of Contemporary Arts, New Orleans / USA, Prospect Biennale 1, New Orleans / USA, Rotunda Gallery, Brooklyn New York / USA, 7th Gwangju Biennale 2008, Gwangju / South Korea, Clark House Initiative, Bombay/India.</span></div>

                <div><span class="poonam">The existing architecture of the street outside the gallery of Kadist Art Foundtion is roped in to an artistic intervention. Blue markings and light - to shade the surface of a pipe, and a street parking sign to which a building residence is tied - removes it from the realm of architecture, into the grammar of an artwork. These markings are like the lines one might stumble upon in graphic illustration, to represent volume by simple  strokes. Using this two-dimensional language on a three dimensional curved surface, the act of pulling in the tropes or codes by which three-dimensional objects are represented on flat surfaces, becomes a visual pun on the grammars of three dimensional-representation. </span></div>
                <div><span class="poonam"> </span></div>
                <div><span class="poonam">JP: &quot;For me it's like comic relief, excessive in its weight for what it is. Nothing about the work is overtly surreal, yet what is suggested by something being tied down is entirely surreal: to think that someone might come and toe the building away is an absurd thought in itself. And then this preventive measure against that, makes it more displaced from reality; and yet it is not that out of step with reality. While it looks as innocuous as it does, it suggests something hysterical if someone were to actually do it, if they were for instance pushed into paranoia.&quot; </span></div>
                <div><span class="poonam"> </span></div>
                <div><span class="poonam">Justin Ponmany, born in 1970 in Thrissur Kerala, grew up in Bombay and went to art school at the dawn of economic liberalisation when India was witnessing changes in industries and technology. The agenda of his works slip into this tryst with technology and its relationships with people within the rearranged sociopolitical fabric. He concentrates on the interplay between retinal and psychological aspects of seeing through video, painting or photography, often tweaking ideas of vanishing points and perspective, investigating what we project onto an image alongside what the image has to say to us. Through the years his works walk a line that treads into the makeup of art, revolving around his seemingly intuitive blend of high theory and rudimentary image-making. </span></div>

                <div><span class="poonam">Once on the periphery of Paris, the flea market at Porte de Vanves takes its name from one of the gates that led into 19th century Paris. 'Le Sang des Bêtes' is  George Franju's iconic movie about a Paris slaughter house that metaphorically comments on industrialisation and the de-humanisation that followed the war. It interestingly also documents Porte des Vanves as a suburb connected to the city of Paris by the metro and the emergence of a marches aux puces or flea market. His first film was a 16mm documentary of the Paris metro and his practice led to the establishment of the Cinematheque Francaise and creation of a new genre 'Le Nouvelle Vague' or the French New Wave.</span></div>
                <div><span class="poonam"> </span></div>
                <div><span class="poonam">The metro to a visitor to Paris often becomes an interesting arena for observation of the demographic that composes the city. Understanding various facets of the directions, timings, and lines leads to one's assimilation into the metropolitan life of the city. Perhaps the modernist Tyeb Mehta while making his film 'Koodal' which had aesthetic and conceptual references to 'Le Sang des Bêtes', used the square outside the Victoria Terminus in Bombay that often is the point of entry of most immigrants into the city and the last station for many suburban lines, to refer to the act of transportation and its ability to create a multicultural milieu.</span></div>
                <div><span class="poonam"> </span></div>
                <div><span class="poonam">Justin Ponmany who travelled each day to the Victoria Terminus to attend art school at the Sir JJ School of Art, using Bombay's suburban railway, was culturally attuned to the manifestations of such a system. Invited to aresidency in Paris during his third visit to the city, the metro became an interesting network through which he could enter and inhabit the city. It finally took him to Porte des Vanves where he spent his weekends negotiating deals for objects that were to his interest. As the flea market closed, the space was occupied by hawkers among whom were migrants from India, Bangladesh, Tunisia, Ukraine and Senegal, some of whom thought him to be one like them and allowed him to collect the objects left behind by others for they believed he would sell them to earn a precarious existence in the city. Later on, as his project progressed, he would visit the hardware stores of Paris which are often frequented by Pakistani or Sri Lankan construction workers. He amazed the attendants by not asking for the assumed products that were expected by a person of his colour.</span></div>

                <div><span class="poonam">Tying down a building to a sign post, (that warns car owners of their cars being towed away) Justin interferes to make reference to the phenomenon of low income housing projects in the city which are being redeveloped, that displace residents to make way for higher-paying residents; akin to his observations of his home city's slum redevelopment projects. While addressing such uncanny similarities between the cities, Justin extends his observations to the metro system, making thread drawings on metro maps showing how people from Francophone Africa, often, occupy the last coaches of the metro, apparently a metropolitan tradition that arose from the practicality of access to suburban train connections or as spaces for a rendezvous for the LGBT community in the 1970s, long before the protests against gay marriage that we encounter today. </span></div>

              <div>Transnational Pavilion is an independent and self-funded initiative, founded by Mihaela Brebenel for the 54th Venice Biennale.</div>
              <div><a href="http://orgmail.mailpro.io/nok.x?e=cG9vbmFtZm91bmRAZ21haWwuY29t&amp;j=NTMxZmNjZmU1ZGM5YjUwYzRlZTI5YWM5MWRhMDQ1YTM=&amp;s=amVoYW4=&amp;l=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mihaelabrebenel.com%2Fwork%2Finstalled%2Ftransnational-pavilion-2011" target="_blank">website_of_transnational_pavilion_2011</a></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The 2nd Transnational Pavilion at the 55th Venice Biennale revolves around the lack of presence. The lack is here not understood in psychoanalytical terms, therefore not linked to desire, drive or gaze. It is the straightforward absence from the scenery, as in a diorama missing a rear foot of a gazelle, or the gap in a film strip where the projectionist subtracted one frame of a black and white celebrity or a nude part of a woman&rsquo;s body. Therefore, this absence is not nostalgic either, nor is it longed for by anyone. It once was there, but it is not truly missing either.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>This kind of absence characterizes the Transnational Pavilion at the 55th Venice Biennale. A concept exists. A list of artists also features in this communication. As such, this absence shall therefore not be understood as any form of retreat, unobserved debris or miscellaneous otherness. On the contrary, this absence is simply a continuation of a reduced scale, which started two years before in the cloud of questions around the grand-scale event which is the Venice Biennale.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Known to most West Africans, the Bantu proverb made famous by the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe during an interview with the Paris Review: &quot;There is that great proverb — that until the lions have their own historians, the history of the hunt will always glorify the hunter.&quot; The program of the 2nd Transnational Pavilion is questioning the act of omission of an artist from a grand happening such as a biennale, reflecting on the geo-political, inner-art conflicts and an economy of funding that brings together such a happening.  It questions the scale and economics of the event, and the act of inviting a certain nationality to present a pavilion announcing their arrival onto an accepted world stage.  </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
                <p>The 2nd edition of the Transnational Pavilion takes place in 12 commercial places in Venice and it engages 22 international artists. The shops and their glass windows could already be considered anti-nationalistic pavilions, where different typologies of goods, from all over the world, are collected and displayed. The Transnational Pavilion invites artists to camouflage their texts, objects, photos and videos in certain shops and their displays integrating their practice in both local and global commercial activities. These uncommon pavilions are addressed to tourists, Venetians and the art public, without invitation.</p>

      <div class="poonam">Prabhakar was born in Chandrapur to a family of coalminers, his ancestral lands acquired by a state-run operator for the mines in lieu of jobs as rehabilitation. A majority of his village is employed within the mines under such an exchange. Prabhakar took a different route graduating in Fine Arts from Khairagarh University, Chhattisgarh in 2009, and in Sculpture from MSU Baroda in 2011. Most of his preceding works were sculptures, or mixtures of sculpture, drawing and light, or where these elements came together in stop-animation films. Prabhakar expresses stories of the mines as he has heard them, and his observation of the relations that exist between the miners, in a style of invented proverbs. They are a mixture of things real with those symbolic, that have accrued cultural or local meaning. He mixes stories heard, with the thoughts discovered during the process of art making. He also slowly evolves certain characters - a manager, key-clockwork cuboids of workers, a mammoth (now coal) of the weight on the miner's mental strength, a perspicacious owl - a personal shorthand of imagery, that recur in his notebooks, drawings and sculpture. </div>
      <div class="poonam"> </div>
      <div class="poonam">In August 2012, at Clark House in Bombay, he had his first solo exhibition called 'Canary in a Coal Mine', taken from the eponymous song by Sting &amp; Police, as a warning of danger to come, just as that week a corruption scam in the allocation of coal deposits to mining corporations in India came to light. It was not only art media, but the main pages of newspapers that carried reviews of this prescient exhibition. The central work was a room filled with charcoal drawings, and drawings with soot, showing the artist&rsquo;s acute observations of the lives of miners. The viewer finds the drawings in torchlight. One frieze within this work, makes use of electric fittings within the walls. Being sources of electricity received from thermal plants, they turn into symbols of power. One of his characters, a Manager, has a socket face, his broad frame adequately fed by power; while thin wiry bodies with pin heads, in need of energy, walk in a slow line to work towards him, clad in shorts and miners' shoes, shovels in hand. Other details convey the sublime trauma of the mine's psychological impact on those who work in and those who live above the mines. </div>
      <div class="poonam"> </div>
      <div class="poonam">Perhaps the best historians, are those who observe their own time and place most fully. Chandrapur is a city in the Vidarbha region of Eastern Maharashtra. The mines were begun in colonial times, and dictate the demographics, industry, and character of the city. The city supplies one fourth of the state of Maharashtra&rsquo;s electricity needs through the thermal power it generates, but it remains aghast at its own underdevelopment. Vidarbha is infamous for the &lsquo;cotton curse&rsquo;, a continuous record of farmers committing suicides, edged on by drought-like conditions, failing cotton crops, and a dire politician-moneylender nexus. For his work in Social Fabric, Prabhakar recreates unseen lines that connect Chandrapur to Bombay, the coal miners and farmers of rural Maharashtra, to the now nearly disappeared, mill workers in Bombay, beginning with the coal that once powered the cotton mills in Bombay, the cotton curse of Vidarbha, and its neglect by a government that sits in the distant hub of Bombay. The unheard plight of the cotton farmers resonates with the situation the mill workers faced as their labour movements were crushed with rise of the ultra-nationalist Shiv Sena, a political party that presently opposes calls for independent statehood in Vidarbha. He charts his own migration to Bombay as an artist, finding resonances with the migration of the mill workers into the city decades ago to work in the mills.</div>

            <div><span class="poonam">The exhibition brings together three artists from distant geographies within India - <strong>Padmini Chettur</strong>, a contemporary dancer, <strong>Prajakta Potnis</strong>, a visual artist, and <strong>Zamthingla Ruivah</strong>, a master weaver, whose works are conceptually engaged with remnant cultural forms, not as endangered traditions, rather to reinvent them in the present. These reinventions spring from the exigencies of political anguish, or the scouring for identities and representations, after the violence of cultural amnesia, experienced over the numbing of years as a kind of saudade. These artists create a complex backdrop of the Indian subcontinent, too culturally conjoined to other geographies for any sense of the nation to arise. In this word saudade, as in the name &lsquo;Bombay&rsquo; (bom baía), is heard the persistence of a Portuguese past. Exigency and saudade, retain the tension of opposites; the consciousness of the past in the present, which permits the envisaging of what is still to come. </span></div>
            <div><span class="poonam"> </span></div>
            <div>
              <div>
                <div><span class="poonam"><strong>Padmini Chettur </strong>was trained in a tradition of dance, revived in the 1930s after a century of forced amnesia. She displaces the choreographic tradition to a minimalistic language, which visually translates philosophical concepts of time and space as they relate to contemporary experience. The sculptural reliefs of lace and light, realised in situ by <strong>Prajakta Potnis</strong> come out of her observation of fissures or peeling walls, as witnesses of the social imaginary of the people who live within them. <strong>Zamthingla Ruivah</strong> revives the tradition of weaving, from the north-east of India, to narrate the events of a community. However, the stories she puts into geometric form, testify to a brutal political history. </span></div>
                <div><span class="poonam"> </span></div>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p class="poonam">In the exhibition, the works will be in dialogue with those of certain Indian artists who were living in Paris in May 1968. <strong>Nalini Malani </strong>described her time in Paris as a &lsquo;<em>prise de conscience</em>&rsquo;. She lends to the exhibition a small papier mache head, 'For the Dispossessed' made in Paris in 1971, out of the vivid pages of Le Nouvel Observateur, and referencing photographs of refugees fleeing the genocide during the Bangladesh Liberation War. The head also references what was happening in Paris, demonstrations for Angela Davis, and protests of the Vietnam War. 'Demonstrators' a sculpture by <strong>Krishna Reddy</strong>, is an eidetic memory of students outside his window in Paris in 1968. The last is a series of sketches made in Paris that year, by the polymath artist and magician <strong>Jean Bhownagary</strong>. Certain cues and gestures - of dance, theatre, magic or music - can come close to those used in protest marches, and fall under social engagement, as much as art. The exhibition intertwines artistic practice with historical contexts, to understand the manoeuvring possibilities of culture.              </p>

              <div>
                <div><span class="poonam">L&rsquo;exposition rassemble trois artistes originaires de régions de l&rsquo;Inde très éloignées les unes des autres : Padmini Chetturpratique la danse contemporaine, Prajakta Potnis est une artiste plasticienne et Zamthingla Ruivah maîtrise l&rsquo;art du tissage. Leurs oeuvres sont conceptuellement inspirées par des formes de culture traditionnelle qu&rsquo;elles n&rsquo;essayent pas de sauver de l&rsquo;oubli mais plutôt de réinventer dans le présent. Ces réinventions naissent d&rsquo;une nécessité face à l&rsquo;inquiétude politique ou d&rsquo;une quête des identités et de leurs représentations. Celles-ci font suite à une violente amnésie culturelle, ressentie pendant de nombreuses années comme une sorte de saudade. Ces artistes donnent à voir la complexité du subcontinent indien, trop lié culturellement au reste du monde, pour que le sentiment d&rsquo;appartenance à une même nation puisse surgir. Le mot saudade par exemple, tout comme le nom de « Bombay » (bom baía), rappelle la persistance d&rsquo;un passé portugais. L&rsquo;exigence et la saudade, comme tension des contraires, serait cet état de conscience du passé dans le présent qui permettrait de trouver les moyens d&rsquo;aller de l&rsquo;avant.</span></div>

                  <div><span class="poonam">Padmini Chettur a été formée à la danse traditionnelle, ravivée dans les années 1930 après un siècle d&rsquo;amnésie forcée. Elle déplace cette tradition chorégraphique vers un langage minimaliste, qui traduit visuellement les concepts philosophiques de temps et d&rsquo;espace au regard de l&rsquo;expérience contemporaine. Les installations in situ de Prajakta Potnis sont nourries de ses observations des différents types d&rsquo;architecture qui composent la ville. L&rsquo;artiste restitue une histoire des disparités culturelles et des troubles sociaux en accentuant les dégradations des logements. Les fissures du mur, l&rsquo;effritement de la peinture, font échos au vécu des habitants. Zamthingla Ruivah perpétue la tradition du tissage du Nord-est de l&rsquo;Inde, associant des motifs géométriques pour raconter les événements de la communauté. Elle en fait toutefois des objets de lutte lorsque les récits qu&rsquo;elle met en forme témoignent d&rsquo;une histoire politique brutale. </span></div>
                  <div></div>
                  <div>
                    <p class="poonam">Dans l&rsquo;exposition, ces oeuvres entrent en dialogue avec celles d&rsquo;artistes indiens arrivés à Paris à la suite de Mai 68. Nalini Malani a décrit ce temps vécu à Paris comme « une prise de la conscience ». Elle prête pour cette exposition une oeuvre en papier mâché, 'For the Dispossessed', réalisée en 1971, à partir des pages percutantes du Nouvel Observateur, qui font référence aux réfugiés ayant fui le génocide de la guerre de libération du Bangladesh. Les Manifestants, une sculpture de Krishna Reddy, est un souvenir des étudiants vus depuis sa fenêtre en 1968. La troisième oeuvre est un masque en céramique réalisé cette même année à Paris, par l&rsquo;artiste et magicien Jean Bhownagary. Certains gestes — en danse, théâtre, magie ou musique — peuvent être proches de ceux des mouvements de protestation et relèvent autant de l&rsquo;engagement social que de l&rsquo;art. Clark House Initiative est une structure curatoriale collaborative basée à Bombay qui, avec la Fondation Kadist, développe un projet où s&rsquo;entrelacent pratiques artistiques et contextes historiques pour envisager les possibilités d&rsquo;un après.</p>

          <h5><em>Caption: Prabhakar Pachpute, untitled sketch, 2013</em></h5>
          <p><span class="poonam">Prabhakar Pachpute is invited to the third edition of the exhibition '<strong>Social Fabric</strong>' to be presented in <strong>ifa (Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations) galleries in Stuttgart and Berlin</strong> in April, curated by Grant Watson, and previously presented in Iniva London and the Bhau Daji Lad Museum Bombay. <br />
            <br />
            Prabhakar's work for 'Social Fabric' links coal from the mining town of Chandrapur, his hometown, to the unionised textile workers in Bombay, through the historic use of coal to power the mills, in chimneys that have come to define the changing skyline of Bombay, as the looming, ghostly factories are converted to malls. Chandrapur lies in Vidarbha, a region with an alarming count of suicides by farmers caused by cotton crop failures and subsequent debts, ignored by the government that sits in Bombay. Making this arresting relationship, he connects the miners of Chandrapur, to the cotton farmers of rural Vidarbha, and the now nearly disappeared mill workers of Bombay. <br />
            <br />
            Prabhakar Pachpute is shortlisted for <strong>ART <em>India</em> Breakthrough Artist Award 2012</strong> for emerging artists, as part of the <strong>Škoda Prize</strong>. The twenty-six year old is one of four artists shortlisted by a distinguished jury comprising Geeta Kapur, Abhay Sardesai, Sangita Jindal and Girish Shahane.The award recognises young artists under the age of thirty-five, based on the artist's debut solo exhibition in India. Supported by ART <em>India </em>Magazine and Škoda. <br />

      </div>
      <div>
        <p><span class="poonam">In the early months of 1943, Abdul Aziz Raiba began his association with the Sir JJ School of Art after being offered a scholarship by the dean Charles Gerard. He graduated with a Diploma in Fine Arts in 1946, and was appointed a Fellow to the painting department for a year in 1947. He returned to his alma mater in 1980 enrolling himself for an evening hobby course in Graphic Print Making at the Print-Making Studio while accompanying his senior who was seeking admission at the Faculty of Architecture. Seven decades later Raiba returns to the College with a retrospective that inquires into his practice, exploring his experimentations with medium, methods of research that inform the subject of his paintings and the unique approach towards exhibition making.  </span></p>
        <p><span class="poonam">Professor Prabhakar Kolte, who was a young lecturer at JJ while Raiba was at the printmaking studio recounts memories of him sitting in the lawns that surround the faculty while he worked on linoleum plates (linocuts). Though by then Raiba had found success and was considered a senior, Kolte found him an affable man who was friendly with students often showing them his charcoal sketches of nature and architectural studies he had done while on the lawns across from the Victoria Terminus, Crawford Market and the Neo-Gothic School of Art building designed by George Twigge Molecey. Architecture often found resonance in Raiba's practices. Intrigued by a book he found at the JN Petit Public Library at Fort, on Portuguese Bombay, Raiba began researching on visual residues of Portuguese monuments destroyed  by the British in an attempt to purge the Portuguese from the Western Coast and desecrated in modern times by a rising population that began to spread  from the islands of Bombay across the creek into Vasai displacing the East Indian Christians who inhabited the fishing villages near the Portuguese forts of Vasai,  Naigaon and Sopara. This research of interesting mythical accounts from the city were illustrated by Raiba in his show 'Bombay XVIII Century' in 1975, of a Dargah (mausoleum of a Muslim Saint) of the Siddis - descendants of Abyssinian slaves. Being a Konkani Muslim from the coast of Maharashtra, Raiba's interest in the city's history was natural. Though he came from a family that had adapted Urdu as their primary language among themselves having published Bombay's first Urdu newspaper, the Raibas married only into Konkani families from towns that dotted the coast around Bombay and they worked traditionally at the city's port authority. The Konkani's were one of India's earliest Muslim communities descendants of Arab sailors who had settled on the coast and converts from Hindu families who often retained their Hindu family names. They were ruled by an Abyssinian Dynasty of Murud and Janjira that often waged maritime wars with the Marathas, British and the Portuguese for control over cities of Bombay, Bassein, Sopara and Chaul. In many villages inhabited by the Konkani Muslims, such as Korlai south of Bombay, Christian communities converted by the Portuguese later called East Indians by the British, and till now speak a Portuguese creole. In the period preceding this exhibition Raiba was forced out of his home in Temkar street, the Konkani Muslim locality near the JJ School due to the collapse of the building he lived in and dire financial constraints that led to his migration to Vasai, now a suburb of Bombay, a city it preceded in history. In the years after JJ Raiba lived in Kashmir, and the Pahari Hills of North India, developing his study of perspective in landscape and collecting motifs and visual techniques from the miniature painters there. He developed a habit of maintaining a record of exercise books with sketches of his studies and folk motifs as reference material, a practice he continues today. Collected through various research trips he made around India, his works that illustrate a mythical history of Bombay, reference a lot of material he collected from his travels to Kerala and much later his last ever such trip to Goa. Though the Bassein Fort in Vasai returned often in his works, so did shark-fishing, rice terraces and the temple near the tank often seen on the Konkan coast.  </span></p>
        <p><span class="poonam">Kolte remembers visiting his exhibitions at the historic Taj Art Gallery, in the Taj Mahal Hotel, a venue much used by the modernists. On one such visit he was surprised at Raiba's use of jute and a mixture of clay and glue as his canvas. Raiba then told him that it was imperative of an artist to battle financial constraints with creativity and use any medium to maintain one's practice, citing an example of using cow dung within the miniature tradition of Indian painting. Raiba until now has grappled with financial constraints. Sakina Mehta,  recounts her memory of Raiba who was a good friend of her husband the painter Tyeb Mehta. Tyeb would often visit Raiba's home where his mother would feed them with rice bloated with Alum so it could fill their stomachs. Raiba began using discarded pieces of glass after he saw glass paintings in Chor Bazaar, using many layers of glass, painting them and placing them one over other to create deeper perspectives depicting portraits of Muslim and Marathi couples much akin to the mica paintings of the Company Painting School. For a mural he was commissioned to make at the entrance of the Gokuldas Tejpal Concert Hall in Bombay he painted tiles with musical instruments firing them in a vitrum studio, a technique taught to him by Rudy Von Leyden. His experimentation of medium might have been urged by his dire financial constraints, it may have arisen from his training as a miniaturist from the revivalistic Bombay School where the students were required to make the surfaces of their paintings called 'Vasli' in Urdu. Presently in his studio that faces a miniature garden in the suburb of Nala Sopara, Raiba endlessly makes sketches on Khadi or handmade made cotton paper, preferring its coarseness for its affinity to jute.   </span></p>
        <p><span class="poonam">Though considered a master by many of his contemporaries, and in spite of receiving excellent critical reviews of his exhibitions, he fell into obscurity as he never saw equal success commercially as the other modernists of his time. Secondly he would prepare extremely researched exhibitions that would study a subject in detail. Exhibitions would be based on themes such as the History of Bombay,  Kashmir: Miniature to Monumentalism, Metaphysical Paintings, the Baramasa of Keshavdas, Mirza Ghalib and Islamic Calligraphy. He would design invites in innovative shapes and Moderist typography, and being a poet himself incorporated translations of Allama Iqbal and stylistic elements of Islamic calligraphy. In one of his last self-designed invitations, he apologises for the lack of a large body of works. His inability to create a substantial body of work, and self-curated shows, led him into retirement from actively exhibiting in the 1990s. Over the last decade having been cheated by unscrupulous dealers and lacking motivation to engage with the art market, he withrew from public view.  </span></p>
        <p><span class="poonam">Raiba believes his practice to be unfinished even today. On the initiative of Professor Anant Nikam, Dean Vishwanath Sabale leant works from his academic years at the college to for the exhibition. Last year the students of the printmaking studio published a portfolio of serigraphs that were screen-printed from the sketchbooks of AA Raiba detailing his practice over the last seventy years. Works from private collections, and from AA Raiba himsef span from a period of 1943 to 2013 will be seen as a part of his retrospective collection. </span></p>

          <p>'The Moons of Jupiter' is a series of photographs of fruit, arranged like the waxing and waning of Jupiter's moons. The title of this work with a mango is 'Thebe', the moon discovered by the Voyager shuttle in March 1979. The mango is a signifier of life, as well as a unit of export and economy. By using the mango to create a kind of calendar, the artist explores the relationship between fantasy, economy, and the famous paraphrase by Zizek at Occupy Wall Street in 2011 - 'It is easier to imagine the end of the world, than to imagine the end of capitalism'. 'Symphonies of the Planets' is a sound installation comprising three audio tracks from the Voyager shuttle recordings made in the seventies of the magnetospheres of the planets, turned into sound frequencies. The three audio tracks play simultaneously, creating a fantasy re-mix of the noise footprint that massive planets make as they orbit the sun.  </p>

      <div class="poonam">'Jinnah plotting Partition' is a decoupage comprising cut-out portraits based on photographs of Mahatma Gandhi and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru on a Nathdwara watercolour background depicting a garden and a stately home in Rajput architectural style. Mother India forms a triad with them, while cut-outs of Mohammed Ali Jinnah and others are shrunk in scale and placed near the fountain, seeming to conspire against a united India. The map of undivided British India includes present-day Burma, Pakistan and Bangladesh and a Mother India emerges from a third eye, carrying the Indian Flag. The medium and the method used was popular during the 1940s in India and we attribute it to Nathdwara, where miniature painters would copy perspectives borrowed from Western academic painting, using photographic references for landscapes that would then be populated by decoupaged images of gods.</div>
      <div class="poonam"> </div>
      <div class="poonam">The exhibition from the Clark House curatorial archive gives credence to a trajectory of art historical scholarship, from Partha Mitter to Jyotindra Jain and Tapati Guha-Thakurta, who subtly interpreted the collapse of visual iconographies of nationalism, fundamentalism, and religious pantheons. The exhibition plays with the chronologies of mediums gaining popularity in India, as put forward by writers like Girish Shahane, from the hand-painted photograph to paintings inspired by photo-journalism, and anachronistically, later by the European Renaissance. The exhibition is also a careful look at a mixture of styles within works: where hunted deer, or fighter planes stylistically differ from the pastoral landscapes that surround them. Toying with calibrations of what has been previously debated, the exhibition adds new iconographies into the fray, from lesser known contemporaries of the better known studios. </div>

        <p class="poonam">Clark House Initiative, Bombay is a curatorial practice about a place, which in sharing a junction with two museums and a cinema, mirrors the fiction of what these spaces could be. Clark House was once an office of pharmaceutical research, an antiques store, and the shipping office of the Thakur Shipping Company that had links to countries in the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Japan. Curatorial interventions in the space hope to continue, differently, this history of internationalism, experiment and research. It was established in 2010 as a curatorial collaborative concerned with ideas of freedom. In this context, previous projects with Eastern Europe are 'Experiments with the Magyars' at the Hungarian Information and Cultural Centre New Delhi and 'Screeing Revolution' Romanian films at Mandalay Hall Kochi.</p>

                  Rafik Omrani / Tunisia / 2011 / 52 min.</p>
                <p class="poonam">Tunis&rsquo;s Kasbah Square was where demonstrators in the Arab world first came together to demand democracy and an end to dictatorship; it also was the site of a long-term occupation following an attack by President Ben Ali. Many Tunisians were satisfied when the dictator was ousted and hoped for an easing of tensions. However, those who risked their lives during the first wave of protests demanded genuine change: the government&rsquo;s resignation and free elections. A second revolution got under way as young people from all corners of Tunisia flocked to the capital and occupied the square for more than a month. When this documentary was being filmed, police were still prepared to use violence and the chance of success was uncertain. Director Rafik Omrani does not record the protests chronologically but instead attempts to capture their atmosphere. He interviews demonstrators and pieces together moments from the revolution: hot declarations, cold nights, shared meals and clashes with police.<br />

                  <em>Caption: Chokri Belaid photographed by Zied Ben Romdhane</em><br />
                  <br />
                  Harakat Al Nahda or Ennahda has ruled Tunisia since the deposition of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. It seeks an Islamic Renaissance and since 2011 has been opposed by the Popular Front a coalition of the Labour Party and the far left Democratic Patriots - which is lead by the now slain Chokri Belaid. As a way to silence criticism over the last year many supporters of the Left coalition were targeted in violent attacks by a militia loyal to the Ennhada legitimised by a committee for the protection of the revolution. The revolution - the Arab Spring began as a student movement led by an underground left wing opposition triggered by the self-immolation of a vegetable vendor Mohamed Bouazizi in the Tunisian town of Sidi Bouzid. Bouazizi's act was in defiance of corruption and the mass unemployment people faced in a stagnant economy under a dictatorship unable to retract its populist mistakes that now ailed the economy. The Arab Spring aimed at producing a state that provided social equality to its citizens and bring an end to widespread unemployment of the youth in Tunisia. Having its affiliations to Hassan Al Banna's Islamic Brotherhood which had imported the revolution into Egypt, the Ennhada has its loyalties to a free market economy and is not concerned in serious efforts towards reducing unemployment and bringing about a system that is equitable. Issues such as unemployment, a social and economic divide, health and education are ignored using the rhetoric of religion. Rhetoric that is supported by indoctrination and mindless violence attracting disgruntled young men into their fold, which last Wednesday on the 6th of February culminated in the assassination of Chokri Belaid. Tunisia beckons another change as a new spring approaches, as protests against Belaid's assassination gained momentum and reacting to the crowds that gathered at his funeral, the present Ennhada government has been dissolved to form a new National Unity government in order to hold fresh elections.  </p>
                <p class="poonam">Zied Ben Romdhane had been awaiting this change since he sees the establishment of a state that recognises the objective of social equality as urgent and most important. Right after the fall of Ben Ali's regime Zied along with his friends, Rafik Omrani - cinematographer, Islem Omrani - lawyer, university professor and electoral observer and Narjes Torchani - a journalist who covers culture, decided to formalise the activities that they had been organising but were unable to form an organisation due to restrictions under the regime. They formed Taabir, The Tunisian Association for Artistic and Digital Expression, a non-government organization aimed at promoting individual freedoms in communication and expression of ideas whatever their specificities. Taabir or Tabeer means the interpretation of dreams. Here, they probably denote dreams of change annotated though photographs and videos. Through its different activities (organization of workshops, training internships, development of digital archives), Taabir wants to contribute to the advancement of digital culture and supports the freedom of knowledge, its production, access to information and justice, whether it is in creative form, artistic form, or in technical terms. Since then Zied has travelled around Tunisia organising workshops on photography and cinema in remote villages, collecting and collating images for an archive, and his present works on view at Clark House - Zones D'attentes / Awaiting Zones and the cinematic production 'Fallega' arise from these deliberations.</p>

          In the first of a series of inquiry into the emergence of a distinct aesthetic informed by a communist political history in Kerala, Clark House uncovers the practice of the Fort Cochin based painter Mohandas. The exhibition reveals the artist&rsquo;s close study of New Left ideas that emerged in the 70s, his close relationship with his mentor the Marxist theoretician TK Ramachandran, and his involvement with the Nila Reading Group - a gathering of left-leaning writers and poets publishing association. Mohandas questions the popular motifs, pictograms, and illustrative practice associated with the left movement, and their possible misunderstanding of ideology, through his depictions of pigeon gatherings, women cleaning the Fort Kochi beach, meetings in gardens, and portraits of his wife, the artist Sosa Joseph. <br />

      Aomori Contemporary Art Centre was designed by the world renowned architect Tadao Ando. Taking care not to destroy the geographical undulations of the site, and in an attempt to make the best use of the surrounding natural features, the construction was designed on the theme of &ldquo;invisible architecture&quot;, with the buildings buried deep inside the surrounding forest. The linear shaped &ldquo;Creative Hall&rdquo; and &ldquo;Residential Hall&rdquo; shaped like a bridge stretched across a valley, and the horseshoe-shaped &ldquo;Exhibition Hall&rdquo; comprising of galleries and a circular open stage, make up the 3 buildings on the site. This unique space is stimulating the artists&rsquo; creativities, and will be a place of new kinds of art experience for visitors. <a href="http://a.organisedmail.com/nok.x?e=cG9vbmFtZm91bmRAZ21haWwuY29t&amp;j=YmE2Y2Y5ZWFmMzQ5Mjc5ZTczOTljNGE5MjRmYTY2ZWI=&amp;s=amVoYW4=&amp;l=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.acac-aomori.jp%2Fpublic%2F%3Flang%3Den" target="_blank">acac-aomori.jp</a></p>

           </div>
        <div>Yogesh Barve's practice often makes use of speed and movement. He creates a drape of yellow sheets of paper with ruled lines that hang from the walls of Clark House, placed near each other, measured to an exact inch, so that the ruled lines move seamlessly across each drape. Here speed is introduced by a fan that disrupts the carefully placed drapes causing a breakage in the continuity of lines. The work stands as the artist's silent comment on the inherent biases in our society, that impede the measures of affirmative action that were guaranteed by the Indian constitution.<br />
          <br />
          Yogesh's father is a signal guard on Bombay's locals.  Yogesh often traverses along with him at the fag end of the train witnessing in speed at the horizon diminishes and the tracks meet.  This experience is often translated into his works where he uses the idea of speed to create visual experiences.  A public project in Vasai is where he replicates the illusion of the train lines meeting,  it extends from a work - 'Equality/Inequality', where juxtaposing two lines of equal length and equal sizes of paper but unequal in placement he comments on various possibilities of inequality despite presumed factors of equality.</div>
